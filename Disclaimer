First and foremost. I would like to say that I am a experienced developer. I've been writing code for almost ten years now. I mostly write C++ code. But in recent times, I have spent a lot of time writing mobile apps.
Although I've been writing code for a long time, Python isn't a language that I am super comfortable with, which
is part of the reason that I am making this video.

Another thing is that throughout the video, the editor that I am using is Sublime Text. I think it is a great editor, but my main editor is emacs. I just wanted it to be easy to see what I was doing, because I have a really weird emacs setup. I just wanted to have transparency.

Everything in this video was recorded live. Any cuts that were made were to take a quick break from whatever I was doing to use the bathroom, etc.

All of the coding challenges that were solved were orginally from a post that came from Daniweb.com.

If you have any questions, you can take down to the comments.
