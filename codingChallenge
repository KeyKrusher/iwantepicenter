1) Guess My Number:
Overview:
The computer randomly generates a number. The user inputs a number, and the computer will tell you if you are too high, or too low. Then you will get to keep guessing until you guess the number.
What you will be Using:
Random, Integers, Input/Output, Print, While (Loop), If/Elif/Else
My Thoughts on Project:
If you are new to Python this is a great learning experience, remember the code you used here and how you used it. This will help your natural learning curve into Python.

2) Sentence Generator:
Overview:
A series of different parts of sentences will be randomly put together to come up with new interesting sentences.
What you will be Using:
Random, Integers, Print, Strings, Breaks, Functions, For, Range
My Thoughts on Project:
A very fun beginning project, have fun with this... Come up with some wacky sentences! Also, this project really gets you to experiment with strings, piecing them together, randoming from a set of strings, and more.

3) Area Calculator:
Overview:
The user will be prompted with a menu where he/she will select a shape. Then the user will give the appropriate information needed to solve for the area, and the computer will give the area! Hope you all have taken geometry!
What you will be Using:
Input/Output, Integers, Variables, Strings, Print, If/Elif/Else
My Thoughts on Project:
Great if you understand geometry and want to write a program that will do a little homework for you! This program is great for learning variables and creation of math related projects.

4) Address Book:
Overview:
The user wants to create an address book and downloads your program. How would you make it? Create a program that prompts the user for the information in most address books and then stores it in a .txt file!
What you will be Using:
Input/Output, Print, Python File Commands, If/Elif/Else
My Thoughts on Project:
This is a great intermediate Python project once you are really going with Python. This will teach you how to access files, edit them, save them, delete them, and more. If you get stuck you can look at my source code but I strongly suggest that you use Google and then try to apply what you find into your program.

5) Text Game:
Overview:
A complete text game, be able to move through rooms on users command, get descriptions of each room, be able to interact within rooms, be able to gain items to gain treasure in your game. I suggest you make your game with as little as 6 rooms with the user moving walls or rocks in order to get an item which they will use to get another item, in order to get the treasure and complete the game.
What you will be Using:
Strings, Variables, Input/Output, If/Elif/Else, Print, While (Loop), Lists, and more
My Thoughts on Project:
By far the project you will learn the most from, don't be afraid to look at my source code. But don't make a clone of my game, make your game original and unique; my way of setting up the rooms and how the descriptions are read should not be the way you do it. There is more than one way to do it in Python, take advantage of it!
